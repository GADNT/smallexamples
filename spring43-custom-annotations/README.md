# Custom annotations with Spring 4.3 (Spring Boot 1.4)

This project demonstrates how you can create your own custom Spring annotations.

Take a look at GreeterService.

Notice the non-standard annotations used on that bean. 

Please note: Just because you can ... doesn't mean that you should.

Use your best judgement here. Discuss it with your colleagues before introducing it on the projects.
