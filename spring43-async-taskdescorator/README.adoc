# Spring 4.3 :: Using a TaskDecorator with @Async functionality

This project demonstrates how you can use a TaskDecorator to transparently copy MDC data from a Web thread onto @Async method threads.

Take a look at the integration tests to see what is expected of the code.
Notice how we expect MDC data to appear with the Web thread logging and with the @Async thread's logging.

Then see `com.moelholm.async.demo.MdcFilter`: this is where the original MDC data comes from.
Then see `com.moelholm.async.demo.Application`: notice how we tune the @Async behavior in Spring to use a custom `TaskDecorator`.
Finally see `com.moelholm.async.demo.MdcTaskDecorator`: this is where we copy MDC data onto the @Async threads.
